## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation is to build was to build a Weather Forecast that you can take and fun a little fun with.
- I took on the quiz to really try and push myself on this project. Still feel like I need a lot of work on the styling side of it. 
- Working on this project has been really tough. Lots of searching and asking questions.
- In this project I found myself adding more and more little details in every way that I could remember. 
- I am learning to keep adding to the code. Trying this and that to see not only what looks best but what works well together.
